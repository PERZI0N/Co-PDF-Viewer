## Issues

The PDF is only updated when a new PDF is uploaded by the admin else it won't show for the existing user
but if users exist and a new pdf is uploaded by the admin it appears for all the existing users.


## To know
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Only one user can become an admin at a time.</span>
</br>
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">The password to become admin is ***vaidik@VIT*** </span>
